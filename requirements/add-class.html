2.2.1.  Creating a New Class Spreadsheet
</h4>
</a>

<p>
In this scenario, we will take a look at how a user can add a new class spreadsheet
manually, via the '<tt>Class</tt>' menu and the Quick Menu commands. Manually adding a class
is necessary to start a new spreadsheet to which a user can add students and gradable items.
Below, in Figure 1, is a sample class spreadsheet that is ready for a user who wants to make a new
class.

<p>
To manually create a new class spreadsheet, the user chooses the '<tt>Class</tt>' menu
command. A list of options will appear and the user chooses
'<tt>New Class...</tt>' to add a new class; this will take the form of the
following, Figure 2.

<p>The other commands in the '<tt>Class</tt>' submenu are Manage Class, Grade Schema,
and Late Policy. These commands will be covered in later scenarios, but for now we
will focus on just adding a spreadsheet for a new class.</p>
<p>
Figure 3 shows the response to the users selection of the 
'<tt>Class New Class</tt>' command.

<br>

<p>The figure shows a dialog box for adding a new class. The dialog box only
takes in a name in a text box, and can be confirmed with the '<tt>Create Speadsheet</tt>'
button below. Confirming the class will create a new tab above the spreadsheet that 
can be selected to switch between multiple classes if applicable.</p>

<p>
When the user selects the '<tt>Create Spreadsheet</tt>' button, the system
displays the newly created spreadsheet in Figure 4.

<p>New classes can be added and dragged to be rearranged in a preferred order. Adding a new
is required to start a new spreadhseet for editing.
<br>

<p>
The scenario itself will not be covered, but for the user knowledge, a class may also be added manually
using the Quick Menu, located above the spreadsheet. To do this, a user selects '<tt>Class</tt>' in the selcection
tab and clicks the '<tt>Add New</tt>' button next to it. This is displayed in Figure 5 below.
