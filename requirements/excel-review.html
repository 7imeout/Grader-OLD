<p>
Excel is one of the most widely used spreadsheet applications.  The functionality of
Excel is tightly integrated with related functionality for visual data displays (such as graphs,
tables, and charts), mathematical calculations, and data organization; Excel even has it's own
Macro programming capabilities for computer programming purposes.  This high degree of integration
is a feature of many modern spreadsheet applications, and is in some sense the
standard for spreadsheet tools.  Many of the organizational and calculatory features of Excel
are sought to be captured in the Grader Tool described in these requirements, though not any
of the extra programming features.
