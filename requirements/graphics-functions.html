2.6.  Graphics Functions
</h3>
</a>
<p>
Scenarios in this section illustrate functions available to the system
administrator.  These functions allow an administrator to change the grade curve distribution graphically, using both a histogram and a pie chart.

<a name="Histogram">
<h4>
2.6.1.  Histogram
</h4>
</a>
<p>
In order to display the histogram for grade curve manipulation the user selects the '<tt>Histogram ...</tt>' menu item in the '<tt>Graph</tt>' menu, as seen in Figure 1.
</p>

<br>
<hr>
<a name="Opening the histogram dialog">

<p align=center> Figure 1: Opening the histogram dialog.</p>
<hr>
</a>
<br>

After the user selects the '<tt>Histogram ...</tt>' menu item, the dialog in Figure 2 is shown and the '<tt>Graph</tt>' menu is automatically collapsed.
<br>

<hr>
</a>
<br>

On the right hand side of the histogram, the numbers next to the letter grades denote the number of students within the range of that grade.

<a name="Pie Chart">
<h4>
2.6.2.  Pie Chart
</h4>
</a>
<p>
In order to display the histogram for grade curve manipulation the user selects the '<tt>Pie Chart ...</tt>' menu item in the '<tt>Graph</tt>' menu, as seen in Figure 3.
</p>

<br>
<hr>
<a name="Opening the pie chart dialog">
<p align=center>
<img src="images/menu-neither-checked-2.png" width="1000">
</p>
<p align=center> Figure 3: Opening the pie chart dialog.</p>
<hr>
</a>
<br>

After the user selects the '<tt>Pie Chart ...</tt>' menu item, the dialog in Figure 4 is shown and the '<tt>Graph</tt>' menu is automatically collapsed.
<br>

<br>
<hr>
<a name="Pie chart dialog">
<p align=center>
<img src="images/pie-chart.png" width="1000">
</p>
<p align=center> Figure 4: Pie chart dialog.</p>
<hr>
</a>
<br>

The percentages shown next to the letter grades within each section of the pie chart denote the percent of students within the range of that grade.

<p>
In order to open both the histogram and pie chart in one dialog, the user checks both the '<tt>Histogram ...</tt>' and '<tt>Pie Chart ...</tt>' menu items in the '<tt>Graph</tt>' menu. In Figure 5, the pie chart dialog is currently open and so the user selects the '<tt>Histogram ...</tt>' menu item in order to display both graphs in a single dialog.
</P>

<p align=center> Figure 5: Opening both the histogram and pie chart in one dialog.</p>
<hr>
</a>
<br>

The graphs that are currently displayed are denoted with a check mark. The user toggles a graph off by once again clicking the corresponding menu item.
<p>
Figure 6 shows the dialog containing both the histogram and pie chart.

<h4>
2.6.3.  Adjusting the Grade Curve
</h4>
</a>
<p>
Figure 7 shows the current grade curve before any adjustment has taken place.
</p>

</p>
<p align=center> Figure 7: Histogram and pie chart dialog before adjusting the grade curve.</p>
<hr>
</a>
<br>

In order to adjust the grade curve via the histogram, the user drags the letter grade buttons seen on the right hand side of the histogram either up or down.
<p>
In order to adjust the grade curve via the pie chart, the user drags the circular buttons on the outside of the pie chart either clockwise or counter-clockwise.
<p>
If both graphs are open, when the user adjusts one graph, the other graph will automatically adjust as well.
<p>
Figure 8 shows the graphs after the user moves the minimum B grade up to match the minimum A grade. This makes it so that no students receive a B grade in the course.
<br>

</a>
<br>

Because the B button is now even with the A button, if the user moves the B button on the histogram upwards, both the A and B buttons move upwards. However, if the user moves the B button downwards, the B section is once again exposed and only the B button will move.
<p>
Likewise, if the user moves the B button on the pie chart counter-clockwise, the A section continues to get smaller, while the C section gets bigger. However, if the user moves the B button clockwise, the B section becomes exposed and gets bigger as the C section gets smaller.
<p>
Any changes made to the grade curve are automatically saved when those changes are made.
<p>
Figure 9 shows the updated gradebook based on the new grade curve set by the user.
