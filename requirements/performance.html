<p>Description:
    <ul>
    <li>interactive commands that should respond immediately; the term to use for these is "effectively instantaneous", which means the command executes instantaneously from the end user's perspective, disregarding any delays that are beyond the control of the software tool itself
    <li>computational commands that may take longer to run; give an allowable maximum amount of time
    <li>maximum size requirements for stored data, in terms of number of data elements, not bytes
    </ul>
</p>
<p>All Grader functionality should execute instantaneously, except for the following:

<ul>
    <li>
        Synchronizing students with the student server
    </li>
    <li>
        Logging in should take some extra time
    </li>
    <li>
        Exporting into various file formats
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    The time to execute all administrative commands must be instantaneous, except
    for any delays due to network transmission of data from the central host.
<p>
    In general, the performance of Calendar Tool commands that must access data
    across a network is subject to potential network delays.  The Calendar Tool
    must transmit data as fast as is possible on any given network, but delays due
    to external network circumstances are beyond the control of the Calendar Tool.
<p>
    There are no specific requirements for the allowable size of a calendar in
    terms of the number of scheduled items.  A Calendar on the order of thousands
    of items is the maximum expected size during normal use.
<p>
    The maximum expected sizes of the Calendar Tool databases are the following:
<ul>
    <li>
        user database -- up to tens of thousands of records
    <li>
        group database -- up to thousands of records
    <li>
        location database -- up to tens of thousands of records
</ul>
While there may on the order of tens of thousands of registered users, the
expected maximum number of users connected to any given server at any given
time is on the order of hundreds.
<p>
    The Calendar Tool must be able to operate with calendars and databases of sizes
    larger than these normal maximums.  However, the tool need not the meet the
    previously-enumerated time performance requirements for calendars or databases
    larger than normal maximum sizes.
