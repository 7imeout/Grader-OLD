The initial display consists of one window: a standard form of pulldown
command menu and a display of the current grade book.  There is also a quick menu which the user can use to more quickly perform certain key actions. To the right is a graphical representation of grade trends and near the bottom are each category and their associated weight, mean, median, and standard deviation.
<p>
Figure 2 shows an expansion of the command menus.

The <tt>File</tt> menu contains commands that output the current state of the
grade book to disk and other endpoints.
The '<tt>File Save</tt>' command writes the current state of the grade book to
disk-based storage.
'<tt>File Publish Student View</tt>' updates the grade book data that is visible to
students. 
'<tt>File Commit Final Grades</tt>' reports each student's final grade to the
Office of the Registrar for official record keeping.

<p>
The <tt>Edit</tt> menu contains commands for manipulating the grade book. 
'<tt>Edit Undo</tt>' reverts the most recent change that the user made since
starting the application. The user may invoke undo multiple times to revert more
that one change.
'<tt>Edit Redo</tt>' executes the change that undo last reverted. This command
is only available when no changes have been made since invoking undo. Repeated
invocations of '<tt>Redo</tt>' will restore undone commands in the order they
were given.
'<tt>Edit Cut</tt>' stores the current selection in the user's clipboard
and removes it from the grade book.
'<tt>Edit Copy</tt>' stores the current selection in the user's clipboard.
'<tt>Edit Paste</tt>' inserts the user's clipboard into the grade book at
currently selected edit point. This command is only available when the user's
clipboard contains compatible data.
'<tt>Edit Delete</tt>' removes the current selection from the grade book.
'<tt>Edit Find</tt>' searches all grade books loaded into the application for a
given text string. Successive invocations of search with an unchanged search
string cause the program to search for additional occurrences of the string
until all occurrences are found.
'<tt>Edit Clear</tt>' removes all data from a row or column in the grade book.
</p>

<p>
The <tt>Class</tt> menu provides commands for creating and managing classes.

for a new class.
'<tt>Class Manage Class...</tt>' allows the user to modify the class name, start
date, end date, etc.

schema. A grade schema defines how a numeric value for a grade maps to a letter
grade like A, B, C, D, and F.
'<tt>Class Late Policy...</tt>' allows the user to change the class's late
policy. A late policy defines the penalty applied to a grade for an assignment 
that is submitted late.
